# React Native GTK4

Check out the package [README](packages/react-native-gtk4/README.md) for more information.

## NOTE: Despite the version being 1.x.x, this project is still in alpha and is not yet ready for production use. We are working hard to get it to a stable state, but there is still a lot of work to be done. If you would like to help, please see the [Contributing](packages/react-native-gtk4/README.md#contributing) section of the package README.

## Missing Components

These components can be instantiated, but they're not following React's state model yet. This means that they can't be used without resorting to imperative code.

- ColumnView
- GridView
- ListView
- MenuButton
- PopoverMenuBar
- TreeExpander
